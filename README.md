# IPRemover
This repository contains code for replicating experiments in our paper accepted by AAAI-24: 

IPRemover: A Generative Model Inversion Attack against Deep Neural Network Fingerprinting and Watermarking.

This code is refactored from our project code to replicate the experiment against MetaFinger.
Our original full project code can be downloaded using the following link:

(The original project code is not restructured and looks messier than this demo code.)
